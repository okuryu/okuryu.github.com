## About me

<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2694/4365409418_370faa5929_m.jpg" width="240" height="180">

My name is Ryuichi Okumura, software engineer in Japan.

I've been started to taking photos from around 2000, and learned art and design.
Photo is part of my life as it's now, so some photos can be viewed at [Flickr].

At the same time, I've been learned web technologies. Of special interest is the
JavaScript world, so I've been contribute to [YUI] since about 2011, and promoted to [YUI Committer]
in 2013. Codes that I wrote is viewed on [GitHub]. I'm currently working for
[Yahoo! JAPAN] since 2007.

Please e-mail to okuryu [at] okuryu.com if you wish contact to me.

Also I'm usually using "okuryu" as username, so you can find me elsewhere.
