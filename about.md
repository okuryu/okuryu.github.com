My name is Ryuichi Okumura. I'm a programmer in Tokyo, Japan. For many years,
I'm having a passion for art and Web technologies. Since about 2000, started to
taking photos and learn art, design. Photo is part of my life as it's now, so
some photos can be viewed at [Flickr]. At the same time, I've been learn
Web technologies. Of special interest is the JavaScript world, so I've been
worked to contribute to [YUI] since about 2011, and promoted to [YUI Committer]
in 2013. Codes that I wrote is viewed on [GitHub]. I'm currently working for
[Yahoo! JAPAN] since 2007.
