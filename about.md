I'm Ryuichi Okumura, a software engineer in Tokyo. I'm currently working
on the developer platforms at [Yahoo! JAPAN].

I love to take photos. I've been started to learn the art and design, and taking
photos from around 2000. Photo is part of my life as it's now, so some photos
can be viewed at [Flickr].

At the same time, I've been learned web technologies. Of special interest is the
JavaScript world, so I've been contribute to [YUI] since about 2011, and promoted
to [YUI Committer] in 2013. And I've promoted a maintainer on [YUIDoc] since 2014.
Codes that I wrote is viewed on [GitHub].

Please e-mail to <a href="mailto:okuryu@okuryu.com">okuryu@okuryu.com</a> if you wish contact to me.

Also I'm usually using "okuryu" as username, so you can find me elsewhere.
