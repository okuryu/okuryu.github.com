title: Move to Jekyll
---
In the past, I have used static files by manual operations, or a CMS tools like Movable Type for
manage web site. From now on, I had decided to use [Jekyll][jekyll]. Jekyll is simple tool to
manage static files. Currently, [GitHub Pages][github_pages] is introducing Jekyll and it being
able to easy hosting files that manage by Jekyll. In addition, if you configure DNS, it will be
possible hosting with a domain that you like. If there are any wrong on this site, you can send
"pull request" to [my repository][my_repository] on GitHub.

About languages which using on this site. I can read, write, listen, speak only Japanese. It may
be easy for me, but English is able to convey my things to more many people. From now on, I'll use
English and Japanese as it may chance on this site. If you can't read it, you can use a translate
service like [Google Translate][google_translate].

In addition, I moved off FeedBurner. The new feed URL is
