title: Idiomatic JavaScript in Japanese
---

Recently, I just [translated into Japanese][idiomatic-javascript-ja] a document
called [Idiomatic JavaScript][idiomatic-javascript].

I don't see any reason that you should have to be particular about relating to
this document, but if you need to write new JavaScript code now, this is very
useful for you. If you are already have any rules in your team or projects, you
should follow it.

Please remember that the code that wrote has a possibility to modified
frequently, used for a long time, or taken over by someone else.

Your code won't belong only to you anyone. We always need to understand the
engineering and keep to write right code.
