As the my goal of the year, I have listed three things. They haven't decided
the concrete contents in advance. Determine goals and only roughly, more I have
to be any good thing to be associated with that goal.

### Contribute to the internet

I sent a total of 50 patches near several OSS. I think most of them are small,
but, whether it is the contribution for each community was able to more than a
little than nothing. Then, I had to write a blog in English this year. As write
once a month, I was somehow continued one year. If I feel tired that I have
every week, as my pace is so good about this. I began to increase little by
little opportunity to use English on Twitter, G+, even such as Google Reader.

### Take photos

Number to take pictures this year has been reduced considerably. I think I
should take a lot to take because it isn't a goal, indifferently in the future.
After that, I entered the dark room for the first time this year in college.
Because I want to go again in the near future, I may continue for some time
as well.

### Go trips

I didn't go anywhere, unfortunately. Since there is no most likely outcome of
the three, I want to go somewhere next year.

I won't change the three things for the next year. Have a good year.
