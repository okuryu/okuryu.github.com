title: Time to YUI 3
---

What should we when to move to YUI 3 from YUI 2? That is yesterday!

YUI 2 is still available via Yahoo! CDN, but YUI team already announced that
they will not fix any issues on YUI 2. And, any features will be probably not
added to YUI 2. YUI team's all resources already moved to YUI 3.

For the migration, incompatible APIs could be a potential setback, but Node
module already has [migration table][node-migration] as core API of YUI 3.
Additionally, the migration might take many times with scale of your
applications, but I think to it may not be so difficult, because YUI 3's
documents is enhanced to offer useful information on
[yuilibrary.com][yuilibrarycom].

Only one important point with you using YUI 3. That is, YUI 3 is oriented
module. YUI 3's module is sheared into fragments (look
[build directory][build-dir]). You should specify module names that you want
use into use() function. Actually, you can use these module within callback
function, it is called YUI sandbox.

	YUI().use('node-base', function (Y) {

		var h1 = Y.one('h1');

	});

Please read [explanation of YUI Global Object][yui-global-object] for more
understanding YUI global object, sandbox, loading module.

If you must need to use YUI 2, YUI 3 has the feature to loading YUI 2 module.

	YUI().use('yui2-treeview', function (Y) {

		var YAHOO = Y.YUI2;
		var tree = new YAHOO.widget.TreeView('tree');

	});

But I am not recommend to using this feature, because the fact remains that you
still using YUI 2. This is used as tentative.

If you develop problems with migration, you can try to file a ticket on
yuilibrary.com, and if you can provide patch for YUI, you can send
"Pull Request" on GitHub.
