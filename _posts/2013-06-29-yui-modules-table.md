[YUI][yui] has continued repeated version up to a lot of this. It is composed of core
modules of more than 400 at present. Also, cases in which modules can be
abolished at the same time as adding the module also has deprecated in recent.
This is an important development cycle in helping to build the YUI platform
with limited resources to provide. [YUI Modules Table][yui-modules-table] is
the YUI core modules table each versions.
