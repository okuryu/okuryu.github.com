title: iYQL 0.3.0, supported HTTPS endpoint
description: I have been updated Node.js version iYQL which I made last year.

I have been updated Node.js version iYQL which I made last year. It added
"--ssl" option to command line in the update of this time.

	$ iyql -h
	Usage: iyql [options]
	
	Options:
	  -p, --endpoint set YQL endpoint URL
	                 default: http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql
	  -e, --env      set YQL env URL
	  -h, --help     print help
	  -s, --ssl      use HTTPS endpoint
	  -v, --version  print version

This was formerly the default the HTTP YQL endpoint, but you can change it
to use at the time of the request the HTTPS YQL endpoint by specifying this
option.

Because YQL tables can usually be used via HTTP, but some tables have become
mandatory request via HTTPS, that would be a good place to use this option
when such.

You can be installed via npm command.

	$ npm install -g iyql

Because I think the ability add more, please check the GitHub repository if
desired or bug.
