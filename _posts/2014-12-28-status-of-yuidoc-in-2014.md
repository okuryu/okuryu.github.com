title: Status of YUIDoc in 2014
description: Status of YUIDoc, features of YUIDoc v0.4.0.
---

As per the issue [#263] and Caridy's [tweet], I took over development of YUIDoc
from YPT (Yahoo Presentation Technology) Team in this October. Actually, I think
that it hasn't entirely transfered ownership of YUIDoc to me because I currently
have YPT Team's full cooperation on as in code reviews. I'd like to push more new
features, enhancements, and bug fixes with maintains backward compatible for a time.

So we have been released YUIDoc [v0.4.0] in this November for the first time in half
a year. This includes new features like that @param tag supports ES6 rest parameters
syntax, other some enhancements and bug fixes. For more information, please try to
check the release note.

I'm planning to release the next version in the next month. All thoughts are
appreciated. Please feel free to file an issue or make a Pull Request on GitHub
if you have any thoughts.
